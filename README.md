<h2>About Challenge.</h2>
This is my second front end mentor challenge. I had a lot of fun with this one and wasn't too focused on getting my code out with perfectionism. It made the process a lot more enjoyable and easier for me to understand as I don't want to write code that I don't understand.

<h2>What I learned ‚úçÔ∏è</h2>
I didn't learn much as this challenge wasn't too different from the first challenge, but my coding is getting more efficient as compare to when I started and I'm writing a lot less obsolete code.

<h2>What I want to learn üìù</h2>
I want to improve my semantics writing, get a deeper understanding as to how to create the best possible web design. I want to learn about variables as well. These are a couple things so far that I know I need to work on. One step at a time, I'll improve my Html/CSS and soon JS. 

<h2>Resources</h2>
I didn't use a lot of things besides perfect pixel and two google searches to give me a better understanding of my code.

<h2>What I need.</h2>
I'm looking for any advice that anyone can give about my component. Areas that I don't know need improvement and resources that could help me. How to improve my accessability. I'm open to any advice and criticism I can get.
